# Actions - Free Actions for Everyone!

Welcome to the Actions repository! This repository is a collection of free and readily available configurations and documentation for various actions that can be used to extend the capabilities of your projects.

## What's Inside

This repository contains:

*   **Configuration Files (`*.json`):**  JSON files that define the configuration for each action. These files specify how the action works, its parameters, and how to connect to external services (like APIs).  We strive to use a function code approach for these configurations to maximize flexibility.
*   **Documentation (`*.md`):** Markdown files providing detailed instructions on how to use each action, including:
    *   How to obtain any necessary API keys.
    *   How to configure the action's configuration file.
    *   Examples of how to use the action in your projects.
